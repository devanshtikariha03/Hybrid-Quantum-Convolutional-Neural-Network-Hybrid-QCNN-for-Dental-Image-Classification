# Hybrid-QCNN-for-Dental-Image-Classification

This project introduces a powerful and detailed implementation of a Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (Hybrid QCNN) specifically designed for automated classification of dental radiography images into a range of dental symptom categories. Leveraging PyTorch for deep learning capabilities, this model aims to support dental practitioners and healthcare professionals by providing reliable classification of common dental conditions such as stumps, implant teeth, missing teeth, patches, periodontal diseases, impacted teeth, and root canals. The architecture of the Hybrid QCNN is purposefully constructed to combine the strengths of convolutional layers for intricate feature extraction with fully connected layers that map these features to specific symptom categories. This model is optimized to work efficiently with RGB dental radiographic images, ensuring it can effectively process the complex textures and nuances found in dental scans.

The model training process involves detailed image preprocessing steps, including resizing to a standardized resolution, normalizing color channels, and applying transformations, which together ensure that the model receives consistent and high-quality input data. A cross-entropy loss function is paired with an Adam optimizer to achieve optimal parameter adjustments, focusing on minimizing classification errors across multiple classes. This setup facilitates efficient learning across the seven targeted dental symptom classes, even when faced with the variability inherent in real-world radiographic images. The project further includes a well-defined evaluation phase, allowing users to validate model performance on a dedicated test set, and a classification function for individual image analysis, enabling a single image to be input and classified instantly.

In addition to model performance, this project aims to create a seamless user experience. Healthcare professionals can utilize the model to quickly process and classify dental images, receiving symptom predictions that can support or even inform their diagnostic decisions. This approach holds the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of dental diagnoses, reduce diagnostic inconsistencies, and lessen the dependency on manual radiographic analysis. With the ability to process a high volume of images in a fraction of the time it would take manually, this model could support larger-scale analysis initiatives, such as identifying symptom trends across populations, or flagging cases needing urgent attention in a clinical setting. Ultimately, by automating the initial stages of dental image interpretation, this project aims to support a more efficient, consistent, and accessible approach to dental care, allowing practitioners to focus their time and expertise on treatment and patient interaction while benefiting from the quick and reliable classifications provided by the Hybrid QCNN.
